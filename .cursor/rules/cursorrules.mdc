# Pacify Project Rules

## SLC-Focused Development
- **Simple**: Every feature must solve a clear parent need. Reject complexity.
- **Lovable**: Each UI interaction should feel warm and empathetic. Add micro-delights.
- **Complete**: Full user flows from onboarding to success state. No dead ends.

## Component Architecture
- Use shadcn/ui components as base, never edit generated code
- Create composite components in `src/components/layout/`
- Keep components under 150 lines, split when longer
- Always add `data-testid` to new component roots

## TypeScript Standards
- Strict mode enabled, no `any` types
- Define interfaces in `src/lib/types.ts`
- Use Zod for runtime validation
- Export types alongside components

## Styling Guidelines
- Mobile-first approach (320px breakpoint)
- Use design system colors: indigo (primary), emerald (secondary), amber (accent)
- Consistent spacing: 16px mobile, 24px desktop
- Touch targets minimum 44px for mobile
- Use Inter font family throughout

## State Management
- Zustand for global state (child profile, settings)
- LocalStorage for persistence
- React state for local component state
- No external API for user data

## Performance Requirements
- LLM API responses < 3 seconds
- First paint < 1.5 seconds
- Bundle size < 500KB gzipped
- Optimize for mobile bandwidth

## User Experience Priorities
1. **Empathy First**: Every response should validate parent emotions
2. **Immediate Value**: User gets helpful response in <30 seconds
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features work without JavaScript
4. **Accessibility**: All interactive elements have proper labels

## API Design
- Single `/api/chat` endpoint for LLM communication
- Zod validation for all inputs
- Structured response format: empathy + needs + steps
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

## Testing Approach
- Unit tests for utilities and pure functions
- Integration tests for core user flows
- Manual testing on real mobile devices
- Focus on error states and edge cases

## Development Workflow
- Feature branch → PR → auto-deploy to Vercel
- Type check before commit
- Mobile-first development
- Test on slow networks

## Quality Gates
- Zero TypeScript errors
- All interactive elements accessible
- Works on iPhone SE (375px width)
- LLM responses contextually appropriate
- Empathetic tone in all copy
